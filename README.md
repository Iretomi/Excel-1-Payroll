# Excel-1-Payroll
A simple payroll to understand few functions in excel.

Managing a payroll spreadsheet with data for employee hours worked and their hourly rates. As the spreadsheet grows, it becomes challenging to calculate overtime, weekly totals, and identify key sections. To streamline this process, I decide to use Excel's built-in features effectively.

 The Excel payroll project successfully automates and simplifies the payroll processing. It helps to efficiently calculate overtime, weekly totals, and averages, maintaining accuracy with absolute referencing. The use of color coding makes it easier to navigate the spreadsheet, even as the data grows. This project demonstrates how Excel can be used to streamline payroll management and data analysis.
